                <p>
                    Hungarian black-jack game for browser designed and implemented by me using semantic HTML,
                    CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game mechanics.<br>
                    Using pngs from objects in my life (vinyl, polaroid, figure) I tried to add some creative personal touch to 
                    the game design while keeping the mechanics clear and somewhat intuitive. <br><br>

                <p>
                    I made this JavaScript and HTML project while following <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY&si=HxeXSpk8B4t9GKn_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a>, 
                    later expanding it through trial, error, and research. <br>
                    The simulation uses a simple neural network to train self-driving cars that improve through mutation — you can adjust the mutation rate, number of neurons, lanes, and traffic density. 
                    These core mechanics, along with the raycasting and segment-intersection logic for car sensors, were implemented entirely by me. <br><br>
                    Each change resets the best-performing car, which can also be saved or deleted manually. <br>
                    And for fun, you can even drive the best car yourself using WASD controls. <br><br>

                <h3>weather.</h3>

                <p>
                    This is a simple weather app I made using Swift in Xcode. <br>
                    It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-inputted city names. <br>
                    The app displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather. <br>
                    The user interface is built with UIKit, featuring a clean layout with a text field for city input, a button to fetch the weather, and labels to display the results. <br>
                    Error handling is included to manage invalid city names or network issues, providing user feedback through alerts. <br>
                    Overall, this project helped me learn how to work with APIs, handle JSON data, and create a responsive UI in Swift. <br><br>

                <h3>c# projects</h3>

                <p>
                    These are some of the C# projects I worked on throughout last year while preparing for my matura exams. <br>
                    They started out as programming exercises meant to strengthen my understanding of C# syntax and basic algorithms, 
                    but gradually became small explorations of logic, recursion, and mathematical thinking. <br><br>
                    I used these projects to experiment with console input/output, loops, functions, and different ways of approaching the same problem — 
                    from simple number operations to recursive algorithms and convergence tests. <br><br>
                    Running these projects on macOS was a bit trickier — Visual Studio Code for Mac doesn’t handle console apps directly, 
                    so I learned to use Bash and the .NET CLI to build and execute them in the terminal.
                    This gave me hands-on experience with environment setup and command-line workflows on macOS as well. <br><br>
